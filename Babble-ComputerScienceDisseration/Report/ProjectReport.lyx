\begin_layout Abstract
This document outlines the core concept and creation of the web and mobile
 applications that encompas ‘Babble’.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Bullying continues to be a global phenomenon that effects populations of
 all countries and across ages, races and social statuses.
 The information age, and the rise of social media and instant messaging
 services has thrown bullying back into the limelight, due to the increasing
 negative behaviour online, that is reinforced by feelings of anonimity
 and the lack of consequences for those who are involved.
 This is also related to the presence of increasingly younger children online
 who are unmonitored in their actions and could feed back into the physical
 world, this of course is another layer on top of the bullying that still
 exists from the pre-internet era.
 Although almost all institutions have taken measures to reduce the number
 of bullying incidents and victims as well as the awareness around the subject.
 In most cases pupils need to speak to either a teacher they trust within
 their school, college or university, or they need a parent to speak to
 them on their behalf.
 The fact that bullying continues to be such a widescale phenomenon shows
 that this strategy and coping mechanism is clearly ineffective.
 The stigma attatched to speaking out against those who are bullies put
 huge amounts of pressure on young people to stay silent, and this in itself
 it the biggest obstacle that victims ultimately need to overcome to fix
 their own situations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
With this in mind, Babble has been built to provide a platform where pupils
 are able to communicate with trusted staff members of an institution anonymousl
y and from the comfort of their own smartphones.
 To break the technology behind Babble down, two applications have been
 built.
 The first is a web application that provides institutions with an online
 portal for multiple members of staff to manage, send and receive messages
 from their pupils.
 The second is a mobile application for Apple or Android smartphones which
 pupils are able to download and message institutions directly.
 The mobile application has no registration or login which means that any
 pupil that has the school’s automatically generated code is able to message
 their institution without the concern of revealing their identity.

Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today’s millennial’s spend on average 223 minutes per day using their mobile
 phone’s.
 (Statista, 2017) In addition, there are approximately two billion mobile
 messaging application users globally.
 (Statista, 2017) Yet, only 1 in 10 teenagers will tell a parent if they
 have been a cyber bullying victim.
 (Bullying Statistics) These statistics make it plausible to say that young
 adolescents greatly prefer to communicate by using their mobile phones
 instead of face to face.
 To support this theory, Childline have recently developed an online chatroom
 service to cater to the changing needs and trends of younger individuals.
 This service allows users to discuss issues they may be facing with a counsello
r and has seen great success since the initial launch by conducting 295,202
 counselling sessions in 2016/17, a 55% increase since 2009/10.
 (Bentley, 2017) This is great progress, however, this project looks to
 provide a safe space for students within the institutions they attend directly
 as opposed to a 3rd party being involved.
 There are currently a handful of anonymous messaging services which have
 been placed within the school system but this project aims to provide a
 unique solution to the alternative platforms available by providing a truly
 anonymous system within which students can build up long term dialogs with
 an institution in a way that makes the student feel safe, ultimately opening
 up dialogues around bullying to help victims deal with their circumstances
 and helping parents and schools cope with a largely hidden phenomenon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bullying is a significant issue within institutions such as schools and
 university and affects almost all children at one point or another (NSPCC,
 2016).
 Bullying can take form in a number of different ways, The National Centre
 Against Bullying describes four key types of bullying which includes; physical,
 verbal, social and cyber bullying (NCAB).
 Physical bullying is typically the most known form which includes physical
 acts of violence such as; hitting, kicking, tripping or damaging property.
 Another well known type of bullying is verbal bullying which includes actions
 such as; insults, intimidation, racist or homophobic remarks.
 These two types of bullying are the most commonly known and easiest to
 recognise as parents or teachers are able to see the physical injuries
 or overhear the perpetrators antagonizing their victims.
 However, another form of bullying, social bullying, is another prominent
 type within institutions.
 This type has been described to include; spreading rumours, playing nasty
 jokes to embarrass and humiliate the victim and encouraging others to socially
 exclude someone.
 The last form stated by the NCAB is cyber bullying.
 Cyber bullying is a newer form of bullying which has come with the rise
 of the internet and smartphones.
 Cyber bullying typically can be recognised as; abusive or hurtful texts,
 emails, posts, images or videos and imitating others online or using their
 login onto social media outlets.
 These last two forms of bullying are a lot more difficult to recognise
 as they are both referred to as covert bullying.
 This means that these forms of bullying can be carried out behind the person’s
 back where pupils are able to discuss and potentially harass the victim
 without their presence or use anonymous online platforms to ridicule the
 victim.
 Although there is a great difference between Social and Cyber bullying,
 considering that social takes place in the ‘physical world’ and within
 greater social networks in that space, as such it could be seen as closer
 to the overt bullying category.
 Whilst cyber bullying can be directly overt, for example hurtful comments
 or posts being made towards others on public social media forums.
 As much as this is similar to the other overt bullying categories, this
 requires monitoring by parents, teachers or other adults within children’s
 lives, which is less likely to take place online.
 Parents may be the only ones with access to their own children’s devices
 but they also need to be able to access all of their social media platforms,
 some of which they may be unaware of themselves.
 The underlying commonality between all forms of bullying is that individuals
 involved, be they victims or onlookers, need to have an outlet to speak
 to an adult in confidence, for any meaningful change to occur.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In light of this information surrounding bullying as a phenomenon, this
 project aims to design and implement a mobile messaging application for
 pupils that can be downloaded onto Android and Apple smartphones, as well
 as a web application for the institution that can be accessed through a
 web browser.
 This will create a platform that allows pupils to communicate with institutions
 about problems they or other people they know, may be facing anonymously.
 Techniques to protect user’s identities will be discussed in further depth
 in the background research section of this report.

Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The motivation behind this project is to provide a technological solution
 to the overwhelming amount of bullying within institutions that span all
 age groups from primary school to university.
 There are currently a number of different options available for bullying
 victims, however the aim of this project is to tackle bullying where the
 problem starts, at the institution, by building a long-term sustained dialogue
 between the institution and the student body as a whole, the hope being
 beyond this platform that children and young adults will become increasingly
 confident in speaking to members of staff and what begins on the platform
 can transition into physical meetings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bullying can often be an overlooked subject by institutions, or at least
 it may be seen to be overlooked and it can and does lead to a deep impact
 upon the victims lives that profoundly affect their mental health in particular.
 This project aims to not only provide an outlet for bullying victims to
 express the problems they are facing but also hopes to reduce the stigma
 attached to speaking out about bullying.

Contribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This project aims to provide institutions with an easy to use system that
 can be embedded into the schooling system.
 Mirroring the anonymity in both social and cyber bullying and most importantly
 the way in which young adults communicate more generally, this platform
 is one of the first steps into providing a constructive solution to tackle
 bullying by creating a safe space that takes away the stigma of speaking
 up.
 Mirroring whistleblowing platforms that are available to adults in their
 professional life and for the reporting of criminal activity.

Technical Aims
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary objective for this project is to create a system that allows
 users to send messages in real time to institutions through a mobile applicatio
n, to maximise the user’s anonymity whilst using the platform, basic security
 techniques will be used.
 These messages can then be viewed and replied to by trusted bodies of the
 establishment, be these nominated teachers who are a part of the wider
 pastoral teams or specific individuals recruited by the school, which may
 be seen to be used more widely by universities who maintain specific institutio
n-wide counselling departments.
 The web application will also need to be designed in a way that facilitates
 collaboration so that multiple bodies from multiple departments are able
 to manage the messages coming into the system from their pupils, this may
 be especially important within larger institutions that cater to a wide
 age range, as is now popular with what were previously primary and junior/middl
e schools becoming one overarching school from age 4 to and 11, and senior
 schools that also have a college or sixth form so cater to ages 11 to 18.
 Considering the emotional maturity, potential tactics, and overall coping
 mechanisms within each age group.

Bullying
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Childline’s ‘Bullying Report 2015/16’, physical bullying is
 the top bullying concern for children under the age of 11, peer pressure
 is the top concern for children aged 12 to 15 and online bullying for young
 adults aged 16 to 18.
 (NSPCC, 2016)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although bullying can take place anywhere, according to At Health, the most
 likely place for a child to be bullied is within their own school environment.
 (At Health, 2014) Not only is bullying most likely to take place within
 the school, the Anti-Bullying Alliance reported that physical violence
 was more likely to always take place at the school, compared to other forms
 of bullying such as cyber bullying which is often out of school hours.
 (Anti-Bullying Alliance, 2017) However, this doesn’t mean that cyber bullying
 out of school does not initially stem from the school.
 Research conducted by Warwick University states that cyber bullying is
 mostly an extension of playground bullying with less than 1% of cyber bullying
 victims being solely bullied online.
 (Warwick University, 2017) This reinforces the idea that bullying for children
 and young adults, no matter the form, almost always stems from the institution
 they attend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studies reveal that bullying can have a deep impact on the victims lives
 with 30% of young people going on to self-harm and a further 10% going
 on to attempt suicide as a result of bullying.
 (Ditch The Label, 2014) Bullying can also follow the victim through into
 adult life with those who have been bullied being twice as likely to have
 difficulty keeping a job or committing to saving compared to those not
 involved in bullying.
 There is also a large spill over into social life where individuals find
 it more difficult to create and maintain meaningful relationships with
 friends and partners.
 These victims are also at a greater risk for health problems in adulthood
 by being over six times more likely to be diagnosed with a serious illness,
 smoke regularly or develop a psychiatric disorder.
 (Association for Psychological Science, 2013)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bullying continues to be a key concern for parents, institutions and the
 government alike, fuelled by the lack of progress made within the area
 in regards to tackling the overall phenomenon.
 The issue and concerns relating to it extend further than incidents of
 bullying themselves but into wider dialogues surrounding, mental health
 issues, suicide, and violence in adult life.
 This can be demonstrated by a result of 36% of children and young adults
 between the ages of 8 and 22 are worried about being bullied at school,
 college or university and a similarly 38% believe their school, university
 or college doesn’t take bullying seriously.
 (Diana Award) In addition, 90% of parents that took part in the Bullying
 UK survey responded stating that the bullying did not stop once the school
 was involved and 39% of these parents felt the school did not take their
 complaint seriously.
 (Family Lives, 2016) However, in 2016 the Department for Education announced
 that Tootoot and 9 other innovative schemes to tackle bullying in schools
 were to be backed with £4.4 million government investment (Department for
 Education, 2016).
 This leads to believe that the Government not only acknowledges that bullying
 is an important matter but are also pro-actively responding by backing
 new ventures to help alleviate the problem schools are facing.

Existing Systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a number of different systems that are in place to try to provide
 an outlet to help tackle the issue of bullying.
 These solutions have similarities to the one that has been proposed in
 this report however, a system that functions in the same way as the one
 proposed doesn’t currently exist.
 The most similar and relevant systems that have been found include; Childline,
 Kooth, Speak Up and Tootoot which will be discussed.

Childline & Kooth
\end_layout

\end_inset

Childline & Kooth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Childline is an established organisation that has provided assistance to
 children for over 30 years.
 (NSPCC, 2016) The charity was initially established shortly after a helpline
 was set up stemming from a BBC television programme on child abuse was
 quickly inundated with calls.
 (Cafe, 2011).
 Childline's primary focus was to have a telephone number where any child
 could call and speak to an adult about any issues they may be having, whether
 it be problems at home or at school.
 To achieve this, Childline started with 100 volunteers in a small office
 answering over 8000 calls per day and has rapidly grown since this point.
 In 2009, Childline launched their website offering children help and advice
 online for the first time.
 In 2016, they then launched a new mobile accessible website with a mobile
 application shortly after.
 This online and mobile service allows children to enter a chatroom on either
 platform and speak to a counsellor.
 Moving forward to the present, Childline has developed further with a continued
 effort on their telephone helpline and a larger outreach using the internet
 with their online and mobile counselling service.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although Childline’s main concern has surrounded bullying since the mid
 90’s, (NSPCC, 2018) they currently focus on three key areas; anxiety, suicidal
 thoughts and feelings and what children who are deaf, disabled or have
 a health condition are talking about.
 (NSPCC, 2017) In 2016/17 Childline provided more than 295,000 counselling
 sessions with the top three concerns young people were counselled about
 involving; mental and emotional health, family relationships and bullying
 or cyberbullying.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kooth is a newer organisation that was launched in 2004 (Xenzone) which
 focuses, similarly to Childline, on providing an online and mobile counselling
 service to speak about any problems they may be facing.
 The main difference between Childline and Kooth is the target age.
 Childline counsels children under the age of 19, whereas Kooth not only
 looks to provide help for children but for young adults as well with their
 program for university students.
 Kooth reports that there has been a 50% increase in students seeking counsellin
g support at university in the last five years and they have helped over
 100,000 young people achieve better emotional wellbeing.
 (Xenzone, 2017) Statistics taken from their users show that 81% of their
 focus group (18 – 25) prefer counselling online compared to face to face.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although these platforms have seen success for many years, it could be argued
 that they have not been updated to suit the needs of modern day children
 and young adults, especially considering that cyber bullying is becoming
 a more prominent form of bullying.
 The fact that both are third party actors does give children an environment
 in which to discuss their problems but it does not provide any aid to those
 seeking more hands on assistance, though still wishing to remain anonymous,
 which naturally would be very frustrating.
 There is no contact between these organisations and the victim’s parents
 or schools which doesn’t bring attention to issues that may be completely
 unknown to both or being generally overlooked.
 To tackle the problem at the root of the cause, there needs to be a much
 greater link between institutions and pupils, which with these systems
 in place is currently unattainable.
 This project sees to bridge this gap by introducing an anonymous environment
 for institutions, which given the success of Childline and Kooth is very
 important, to pastoral teams directly.
 By doing so it should relieve feelings of hopelessness that students may
 be feeling as the system not only acts as a counselling service but as
 a tip line, which should kick start more practical action to end bullying.

\end_inset

Speak UP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speak UP is an American for profit company founded in 2015 which focuses
 on providing an application students can use to stay safe in school and
 online.
 Similarly to Kooth, they hope to provide a solution for both pupils at
 schools and universities that may be having issues.
 Speak UP has taken a different approach to Childline and Kooth and have
 developed a product which allows students from either schools or universities
 to report issues they may be having to their institution.
 According to their website, it states that 39% of bullied children and
 teens have never told anyone that they are being bullied, 15% of university
 students reported being bullied and 22% of university students reported
 being cyberbullied.
 (Speak UP) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speak UP provides a similar system to the one this project aims to achieve
 as they have a web application built for schools to use and a mobile applicatio
n for their pupils.
 They have two package types, one for schools and one for universities which
 appear to have the same functionality.
 Their platform allows users to report incidents either anonymously or include
 information in relation to their personal account.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main difference between Speak UP and what this project looks to achieve
 is that instead of providing a platform which facilitates communication
 between the two applications, their system focuses on allowing users to
 report specific incidents using the mobile application more centred around
 individual events such as acts of violence.
 These reported issues are then shown on the web application for the appropriate
 person to take action.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It also appears that the focus of the application they provide, targets
 isolated incidents between specific people, which again is not the aim
 of this project, which hopes to tackle bullying on a much larger scale
 by opening and maintaining a dialogue which encompasses reporting incidents
 and counselling all in one.
 Although the concept behind Speak UP is similar to the one which this project
 aims to achieve, Speak UP’s system requires users to have accounts to report
 issues they may be having which is detrimental to the user’s anonymity.

Tootoot
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tootoot is a UK based, for profit company which was founded in 2015 which
 focus on giving a voice to children and young people.
 Similar to Speak UP, Tootoot have developed a product which allows students
 to report incidents directly to the school themselves.
 Tootoot’s website states that their product is in place in thousands of
 schools globally, showing that they may be the most widely used tool to
 tackle bullying directly within the school.
 Most recently, the two co-founders of the company have been named on Forbes’
 30 under 30 list for Europe (Forbes, 2018), and have raised £750k in Series
 A funding.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tootoot provides the most similar platform to the one this project is aiming
 to achieve.
 Their product works on web, tablet and mobile applications which allows
 either the institutions staff members or their pupils to log into their
 personal accounts.
 From there, pupils are able to upload images and file incidents reports
 for staff to then take further and resolve the issue.
 Tootoot also allows students to communicate with staff surrounding the
 incidents they have reported.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although this system is similar to the one this project aims to achieve,
 there are a few small differences.
 The main difference between Tootoot and this project is that instead of
 providing a platform which is centred around communication, Tootoot, similarly
 to Speak UP have a platform that centres around reporting incidents with
 the added feature of communication, opposed to focusing on the communication
 aspect by building up and maintaining a dialogue between the school and
 the pupil which this project aims to achieve.

\begin_layout Standard
Since Edward Snowden released information pertaining to the capabilities
 and actions of the NSA in 2013 where the NSA collected phone data from
 millions of Verizon customers (Greenwald, 2013), privacy has become an
 increasingly key concern for messaging application users.
 This section will discuss the anonymity and encryption techniques used
 in three focus applications; WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WhatsApp was founded in 2009 with the mission statement to provide an alternativ
e to SMS.
 Since then, it has been acquired by Facebook and is a globally recognised
 application with over 1 billion users in over 180 countries (WhatsApp,
 2018).
 In terms of security, WhatsApp’s primary focus is to provide a secure messaging
 platform with end-to-end encryption, meaning that no third party, including
 WhatsApp, can read or listen to any messages sent using their platform.
 Not only do they provide this form of encryption, WhatsApp states that
 messages sent to users are not stored on their servers once they have been
 delivered to the recipient, meaning that the messages are then stored locally
 on the user’s smartphone.
 (WhatsApp, 2018) 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Telegram is a more recent application and was founded in 2013 with a mission
 to provide a new era of messaging with a focus on security and speed.
 Telegram founders have since stated that the messaging platform isn’t for
 sale no matter what the price (Kravchenko, Ali, Khrennikov, 2017) and has
 seen over 200 million users adopt the platform.
 Similarly, to WhatsApp Telegram puts a large focus on end-to-end encryption
 but also offers users the option to send self destructing messages which
 are permanently deleted after the message has been viewed.
 However, in 2016 Iranian security and technologist researchers were able
 to access more than 15 million Iranian Telegram users mobile phone numbers
 (Newham, 2016).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last messaging application that will be discussed is Signal.
 Signal is another newer application that was founded in 2014 and has recently
 received a $50 million investment from WhatsApp co-founder, Brian Acton.
 (Greenberg, 2018) Similarly to WhatsApp and Telegram, Signal also has a
 large focus on end-to-end encryption, using an open source license allowing
 experts to test the encryption themselves to ensure the encryption is as
 secure as intended.
 (McMahon, 2017) However, unlike WhatsApp and Telegram, Signal has implemented
 another security measure to protect users privacy by allowing users to
 force individual conversations to delete themselves after a designated
 amount of time.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These applications have been selected and considered whilst researching
 security protocols to implement within Babble.
 This research will help facilitate the end goal and ensure that users are
 confident in their anonymity and institutions are not fearful of data being
 leaked out to the public highlighting cases of bullying that could be damaging
 to reputation, all of which being centered around trying to reduce the
 stigma attached to speaking out in the face of bullying, no matter the
 medium.

Encryption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
End-to-end encryption comes in a variety of different forms with different
 complexity levels.
 As discussed previously, encryption is a highly important topic for messaging
 applications due to recent data leaks.
 Two encryption protocols will be reviewed and discussed with the intention
 of one being implemented into the system this project aims to achieve.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first protocol is RSA encryption.
 RSA was first publicly described in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and
 Leonard Adleman (Rouse, 2014).
 This form of encryption is described as an asymmetric algorithm which uses
 two mathematically linked keys, a public key, and a private key to encode
 and decode data.
 Once the set of keys has been generated, the public key is then distributed
 to parties wanting to send data.
 By using another mathematical formula, the sender encrypts their message
 with the recipients public key and sends the encrypted message to the recipient.
 The recipient then uses another mathematical formula to decrypt the message
 using their private key ensuring that only they are able to view the message.
 Due to the fact that both keys are mathematically linked, only the matching
 private key is able to decrypt the message.
 This algorithm has since become the known standard for encrypting messages
 and is widely used today.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second protocol is AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
 AES began development in 1997 by the NIST (Rouse, 2014) and was chosen
 by the U.S.
 Government to protect classified information.
 This form of encryption is known as a symmetric algorithm which uses the
 same key to encrypt and decrypt data.
 Once a key has been decided, the message is then encrypted using the key
 by performing several processing steps that include substitution, transposition
 and mixing of the plaintext and transforming it into the final output of
 encrypted text (Rouse, 2014).
 Each time this step is performed, this is called a ‘round’.
 Depending on the length of the key, there are a different amount of ‘rounds’
 that take place.
 If the key length is 128 bits, there are 10 rounds, if the key length is
 192 bits there is 12 and if the key length is 256 bits, there are 14 rounds.
 AES is a robust encryption algorithm that has had vigorous testing for
 vulnerabilities which became the reason the U.S.
 Government chose this form of encryption was due to its resilience of these
 attacks.

Functional Requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system being proposed allows students to contact the institution they
 attend by using a mobile application downloaded onto their smartphones.
 These messages will then be delivered to the institution on a web application
 that staff members are able to access.
 The system must allow the institution to register by using the web application
 to create an account and then each team member of the institution will
 be able to login using their own account.
 Once logged in, users must be able to create or remove new team member
 accounts, manage the permissions these accounts are allowed, update their
 account details and change their password.
 Aside from the team’s user account settings, the portal must also allow
 users to view basic analytics of the team’s progress, their entire team’s
 basic details and the messages that have been sent to and from the institution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mobile applications must allow the ability for students to; send messages
 to institutions without the necessity of registering an account, start
 new conversations, send and receive encrypted messages with the institution
 and have the option to end the conversation once the conversation has come
 to an end.

Technical Risks

Technical Risks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the fact that this system is designed for the use of students who
 wish to contact their institution anonymously, anonymity techniques must
 be implemented to protect the user’s identity.
 To ensure this is the case, any feature that could expose a user’s identity
 should not be included into the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the mobile application has been released onto application store’s,
 the application will then be available for anyone to access.
 Steps must be taken to ensure that institutions do not receive unsolicited
 messages from users that are not at the institution they represent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core purpose of the system is to discuss problems young adults or children
 may be having with their school or university.
 Features that could detract from this will not be included such as allowing
 students to communicate with one another on the platform.

Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system that has been proposed consists of two parts; the web application
 for institutions and the mobile applications for a range of students at
 school or university.
 Due to the variety of users the mobile application will receive, the system
 must be simple to use and only include necessary functionality.
 The web application however can be more complex and have a higher level
 of functionality as the user demographic is likely to require this for
 analytical and organisational purposes.
 Both applications must be simple to set up or download.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system design will take an agile approach and be designed in a modular
 fashion so that updates to the functionality of either application can
 be updated or replaced.
 The system will heavily rely on a database which stores user information,
 therefore both applications must have access to this database and the ability
 to manipulate data within it.

Web Application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The web application will consist of seven pages.
 The user will initially see one of two pages when the web application is
 first accessed, either the login or register page.
 On either of these pages there will be four buttons a user is able to select.
 This includes; a register button to take the user to the registration page,
 a login button to take the user to the login page, a privacy button to
 take the user to the privacy page and a terms button to take the user to
 the terms of use page.
 The privacy and terms of use pages will then display either the applications
 privacy policy or terms of use policy to the user.
 On the registration page, a user is able to register their institution
 which will also register an ownership account within the institution’s
 account as the primary admin.
 On the login page, a user is able to log into their account to access the
 institutions portal.
 Once a user has logged in, the user is redirected to their institutions
 dashboard page.
 This page consists of a navigation bar where the user is able to navigate
 through the web application, basic analytics of the performance of the
 institution and the current team that is associated with the institution.
 On the navigation bar, the user is then able to direct themselves to either
 their profile, select a conversation that a student is having with the
 institution or logout from the system.
 On the profile page, the user is able to update their account details and
 change their accounts password.
 When a user selects a conversation from the navigation bar, the user will
 be taken to the messaging page which will display all of the messages sent
 to and from the institution within that conversation.
 Depending on whether the conversation has been archived or not, the user
 will then be able to send messages to the student.
 The following diagram gives a visual demonstration of the web application’s
 user flow.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mobile application will be designed to have six pages.
 The first page a user will see is the home page, introducing the application
 to the user.
 From there, they will have 3 buttons to choose from.
 One button will take the user to a page which details the applications
 privacy policy, another button will take the user to a page which details
 the applications terms of use policy and the third will take the user to
 a conversations page, listing all of the conversations they currently have
 open.
 From this conversations page, users will have the option of selecting either
 an existing conversation or selecting an icon acting as a button to start
 a new one.
 The page displayed once a user has selected the new conversation button
 will allow the user to enter the institutions code they wish to speak to.
 Once submitted, this will then redirect the user back to the conversations
 page and create a new dialog.
 When a user selects a conversation they wish to view, all of the messages
 between the institution and the user will be displayed and the user is
 then able to send new messages to them.
 The following diagram gives a visual demonstration of the mobile application’s
 user flow.

The database management system that will be used for this system is MySQL,
 a relational database.
 ‘A relational database is a set of tables containing data fitted into predefine
d categories.
 Each table (which is sometimes called a relation) contains one or more
 data categories in columns.
 Each row contains a unique instance of data for the categories defined
 by the columns.’ (Rouse, 2015) The MySQL database will be designed to contain
 five key tables.
 These tables will be labeled; Institute, Team, User, MessageGroup and Messages.
 The Institute table will consist of core information relevant to the institutio
ns.
 The Team table will contain web application user accounts and relevant
 details for their accounts.
 The User table will contain the mobile applications identification number
 to associate conversations with.
 The MessageGroup table will contain information specific to a conversation
 as a whole and the Messages table will contain all of the messages in a
 message group which have sent between the web and mobile applications.

API

\begin_layout Standard
For the mobile application to access the server’s database, a basic API
 will need to be created and allow the mobile application to create, read,
 update and delete (CRUD) data.
 An API (Application Programming Interface) ‘is a software intermediary
 that allows two applications to talk to each other’ (Mulesoft, 2018).
 The API for the system this project aims to achieve will be used for processes
 such as creating new conversations, retrieving messages between the two
 applications stored in the database and sending new messages between the
 applications.

Security
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although an implementation of the RSA algorithm would have been more appropriate
, AES was chosen due to the time constraints of the project, as the algorithm
 is already built into MySQL.
 A random key was then generated using an online random string generator.
 (Unit Conversion, 2018) The output of the random string generator was ‘xw0o9TKg
Fn’ and used throughout the system to encrypt and decrypt messages.
 When a new message row is entered into the Messages table of the database,
 the MySQL function AES_ENCRYPT is used in combination with the randomly
 generated string.
 This then produces an encrypted message which is stored in the database.
 To retrieve the row and decrypt the message, the MySQL function AES_DECRYPT
 is used in combination with the same randomly generated string.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To protect user’s personal information, PHP has many built in functions
 to hash the users password.
 The hashing function that was chosen for this system was MD5 due to the
 speed of which the hashing algorithm performs.
 Once a password is hashed, the hashed password is then irreversible which
 means that the original password cannot be retrieved from the database.
 Instead, when a user logs into the web application the same password must
 be entered and then hashed using the same hashing algorithm.
 Once the password is hashed, it is then compared with the one in the database,
 if this newly hashed password matches the entry in the database then the
 user is granted permission to login.

Web Application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The web application has been built using MVC (Model View Controller) architectur
e.
 This was chosen as, by separating the application into three parts, the
 application becomes modular and easily maintainable.
 The model files of the project contain the main logic for the application.
 The view files typically contain the html of the application and displays
 to the user what they are able to see and interact with.
 The model and view elements are then controlled by the controller files.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An index file was created as the main web application’s controller.
 When a user clicks a button on the web application, the page they navigate
 to will contain the variable ‘page’ which is passed to the URL parameters.
 Depending on what the variable value is, will depend on what PHP file the
 index will include.
 For example, if the page’s URL end’s in ‘index.php?page=register’ then the
 register page’s controller would be included.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to time constraints, an existing front end for this projects web application
 was purchased from ThemeForest.
 This was done to ensure that the main emphasis could be put onto the applicatio
ns back end due to its complexity.
 To produce a front end from scratch, the project would require learning
 entirely new skill sets to utilise and write JavaScript, HTML and CSS elements
 of the project.
 This was deemed too time consuming so an online template for the front
 end was purchased.
 This template was then customised to suit the specifications of the project.
 The purchased template’s original files have been included in the appendices
 of the document.

Register
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The registration page, as outlined in the design section, consists of four
 buttons.
 Once selected, these buttons either reload the registration page, redirect
 the user to the login page, redirect the user to the privacy page or redirect
 the user to the terms of use page.
 There is a form on the right hand side of the registration page allowing
 users to register a new institution.
 This form consists of four text boxes and a submission button.
 The four text boxes include; the institution name, the email for the main
 ownership account and two password fields for the ownership account.
 The user has to enter their desired password twice to ensure the correct
 password has been entered.
 Once a user submits this form, the post data is then handled by the register
 model which firstly checks if the passwords match.
 If the passwords match, the model then checks whether the email address
 is in use already by retrieving all of the rows in the Team table of the
 database which has this email address.
 If the database query does not retrieve any rows which contain the desired
 email address, the model then inserts a new row into the Institute table
 of the database with the institutions name.
 The model then inserts a new row into the Team table with the users email
 and password and has their account type set to ‘owner’.
 Session variables are then set using the institutions identification number
 from the Institute table of the database, their personal identification
 number from the Team table of the database, their account type from the
 Team table of the database and a boolean of whether they are logged in
 is set to true.
 The user is then redirected to the dashboard page.

 There is a form on the right-hand side of login page where users are able
 to enter their account’s email address and password.
 Once the form is submitted, the post data is handled by the login model
 which creates a new database query for the Team table of the database.
 This query checks to find a row which contains the entered login details,
 if the details they have entered are correct, a single row will be retrieved.
 The model then sets session variables which include the institutions identifica
tion number from the Institute table of the database, their personal identificat
ion number from the Team table of the database, their account type from
 the Team table of the database and a boolean of whether they are logged
 in is set to true.
 The user is then redirected to the dashboard page.

Dashboard
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once a user logs into the web application, the user is redirected to the
 institution’s dashboard page.
 At the top of the dashboard page, a number of basic analytics are displayed.
 The first performance analytics shows how many new conversations have been
 instigated within the last month with a percentile comparison between the
 current and previous month.
 Following this, the next two analytics show how many messages have been
 received and how many have been sent within the past week with a percentile
 difference between the current and previous week.
 Finally, the last analytic shows the total amount of messages that have
 been sent and received within the last day, a percentile difference is
 also displayed comparing the current and last day.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below this, the dashboard page then displays the team section which includes
 all of the current team members for that institution.
 Information relating to each team members name, title and account type
 is displayed on each row.
 If the user logged in has either an admin or owner account in the Team
 table of the database, the user is able to view two buttons on the left
 side of each team member’s row, allowing the user to either promote other
 team members to admin accounts, demote other admins to regular accounts
 or remove the user account altogether.
 The institution’s owner account cannot be modified.
 If the user logged in has an admin or owner account, they are also able
 to select a team members name which will redirect the user to the selected
 team members profile page.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The applications main navigation bar is shown on the left-hand side of the
 dashboard page.
 This navigation bar includes a drop-down selection at the top of the navigation
 bar.
 When a user selects their institution’s name at the top of the panel the
 drop down then expands and reveals three options for the user to select
 which either navigates the user to the dashboard, their personal profile
 page or log them out from the application.
 Below this drop down, messages are displayed in three groups.
 The top group of the conversations section shows all of the messages the
 institution has received but hasn’t read yet.
 These conversations are highlighted with a light blue colour to separate
 them from the rest of the messages.
 After these highlighted messages, previously read messages are displayed
 in a darker blue colour.
 The third section of the conversations are separated with a new title ‘Archived
’ where all of the archived messages are displayed.
 The left-hand navigation bar uses AJAX and JavaScript to reload the conversatio
ns every second.

\begin_layout Standard
When a user selects the profile button on the left navigation bar or if
 an admin or owner account has selected a team members account from the
 dashboard page, the appropriate user’s information will be retrieved from
 their row of the Team table in the database and displayed on the left-hand
 side of the profile page.
 The information displayed consists of their personal identification number
 in the Team table of the database, the institution they are a team member
 of, their name, their job title and their email address.
 On the right-hand side of the page there are two submission forms.
 The top form is in place to update the user accounts name, job title and
 email address.
 When this form is submitted, the team members row in the Team table of
 the database will be updated with the new account details.
 The bottom form is in place to change the user’s password.
 The user wishing to making the amendments to the account’s password must
 enter their current password and the new password they would like the account
 that’s being edited to have.
 Once this form has been submitted, the user’s password is then hashed and
 compared with the password column of their row in the Team table of the
 database.
 If the password is correct, the new password is then hashed and updated
 for the users profile in the Team table of the database.

Each of the conversations on the left-hand navigation bar have an encoded
 variable of the conversations identification number for the row in the
 MessageGroup table of the database.
 When a user selects one of the conversations from the left-hand navigation
 bar, the user is then redirected to the messaging page.
 This encoded identifation number is then decoded and all of the conversations
 messages from the Messages table of the database are displayed on the page.
 These messages are then split to either the left-hand side of the page
 for messages received from the mobile application or the right hand side
 of the page for messages sent from the web application.
 Beneath the messages, depending on whether the conversation has been archived
 or not, a submission form allowing users to enter new messages is displayed.
 Once a user submits a message, a new row is inserted into the Messages
 table.
 If the conversation has been archived, the submission form will not be
 shown.

The mobile application for this system has been created using Ionic’s web
 application ‘Creator’.
 Ionic Creator’s web application assists in creating front end user interfaces
 for mobile applications rapidly.
 Ionic Creator is based off of the Ionic Framework in combination with Angular.JS.
 Ionic’s platform then allows users to export their application to the raw
 files compressed to a zip file or compile them to Android APK files or
 Apple IPA files.
 Ionic creator was selected to rapidly prototype a working application for
 both Android and Apple devices.

Home
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The home page, as outlined in the design section consists of three buttons
 to either redirect the user to the privacy page, redirect the user to the
 terms of use page or redirect the user to the conversations page.
 Once a user selects the button redirecting to the conversation page, an
 Angular.JS function initiates an API call creating a new row in the User
 table of the database, the identification number of this new row is then
 returned to the mobile application and stored locally as a cookie.
 If the user then closes and reloads the application, once the home page
 loads, the application will check if there is a locally stored identification
 number.
 If the application finds an existing variable, the user will be redirected
 to the conversation page to avoid generating a new row in the database
 and identification number.

\begin_layout Standard
This page loads an Angular.JS function as soon as the page is loaded.
 This function makes an API call retrieving all of the rows from the Messages
 table in association with the MessageGroup identification number and is
 repeated every second.
 An object array of all the messages is then returned.
 If the message in the object array was sent from the web application, the
 message is displayed on the left-hand side of the page along with the time
 the message was sent, if the message has been sent from the user on the
 mobile application, the message is displayed on the right hand side along
 with the time the message was sent as well.
 At the bottom of the page there is a form where users are able to enter
 new messages on their phone.
 When the form is submitted, an Angular.JS function is triggered making another
 API call to insert the entered message into the Messages table.
 The header of the page is titled with the institution this conversation
 is relating to and an icon to archive the conversation is on the right-hand
 side.
 When this icon is selected, an alert box allowing the user to either cancel
 the action or delete the conversation appears.
 If the cancel button is selected, the alert box is closed and the user
 is returned back to the same page.
 If the delete button is selected, an API call is made which updates the
 row in the MessageGroup table to set the status for both the mobile and
 web applications to ‘archived’.
 The user is then redirected back to the conversations page.

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, the project has met the initial objectives of providing a system
 that facilitates communication between students and the institutions they
 attend.
 The system has met the outlined specification that the project was set
 to achieve and has completed vigorous testing to ensure that the system
 works as intended.
 The specification included building a web application for institutions
 to use through their web browser and mobile applications for students to
 download onto their smartphone’s which have been completed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, the system has incorporated security measures protecting the user’s
 identity and ensuring that messages sent to and from the institution are
 encrypted in case of a data leak from the database.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, the project has been successful and everything that was originally
 detailed as set out to achieve has been accomplished.

Skills Obtained

\end_inset

Skills Obtained
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the course of this project, a number of new skills have been established
 and existing ones have been built on in relation to both computing specific
 and general.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In relation to specifically computer based skills, the Angular.JS programming
 language and Ionic mobile development framework are both computing elements
 where there was no prior knowledge before the beginning of the project.
 Now the foundation for these skills have been developed, they can be called
 on again with future mobile development.
 Angular.JS, being a language not only used for mobile applications can also
 be used for future web development projects and is the beginning of acquiring
 an entirely new skill set within web development as it is a fundamental
 element of the MEAN stack, opposed to the LAMP stack that has been used
 for the web application in this project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were a number of programming languages where there was prior knowledge
 before the implementation of the system proposed.
 These languages consist of PHP, Ajax, HTML/CSS and MySQL.
 These existing skills have been developed further and new skills within
 each skill set has been acquired.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Constructing an API to connect with the MySQL database was another skill
 that has been acquired over the course of this project.
 Although an understanding of PHP was already established, accessing a PHP
 file that was not on the same server with an Angular.JS function was something
 that had never been attempted before.
 This basic API concept can be used again for future web development projects.
 The last computing specific skill which had been developed is the implementatio
n of basic security practices.
 Although an understanding of encryption existed prior to the construction
 of the system, implementing an encryption algorithm into a whole system
 was a newly acquired skill.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unrelated to specific computing skills, managing a solo project has been
 the underlying skill that has evolved throughout the entire process of
 the project.
 This has helped to increase time management, planning and testing skills
 within a project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before this project, an understanding of how bullying affects students was
 present but not to the same extent as after the project.
 This new-found knowledge and understanding will help to develop future
 projects specifically aimed for bullying victims.
 An understanding of how messaging platforms work has also been established.

Further Work
\end_layout

\end_inset

Further Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system that has been built could be expanded by implementing additional
 features for both the web and mobile applications.
 The area that could receive the most additional development is within the
 web applications messaging system.
 The core features that could be implemented include; facilitating messaging
 between individual team members or groups of team members of an institution
 to discuss a specific case, allowing team members to attach internal notes
 within conversations with students for future reference and allowing team
 members to assign conversations to themselves so they are the primary contact
 for a student.
 Due to requiring simplicity because of the demographic for the mobile applicati
on, a limited number of features could be implemented into the application.
 However, the obvious feature that would be implemented is allowing users
 to send images alongside text.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other areas of the system that could be developed further include; implementing
 the RSA encryption algorithm where a unique set of keys are generated for
 each mobile application user and incorporating a similar idea to the one
 from Speak UP and Tootoot’s platform by allowing users to report specific
 cases as well as message the institution directly.
